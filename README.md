# SULI Computational Workshop 2022

This repository contains the notebook and environments to be used in
the 2022 SULI [Introduction to Fusion Energy and Plasma Physics
Course](https://suli.pppl.gov/2022/course/).

## Opening the notebook environment in your browser (recommended)

To create an environment that you can run from your web browser with
everything you need for the SULI workshop, click on one of the
following badges to open the notebook in Google Colab or Binder.

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PlasmaPy/SULI-2022/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb) (requires a Google account)

[![Open in Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PlasmaPy/SULI-2022/main?labpath=tutorial.ipynb) (times out after 10 minutes of inactivity)
